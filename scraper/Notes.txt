Design Notes for scraper.py

root directory:
    maktaba.tetea.org/exam-results/

loop through each subdirectory named "CSEE*"
    loop through each file named "[p|s]*"

make one CSV file for each CSEE subdirectory
    - concatenate the contents of the tables in the files in each subdirectory
    - create an extra column with the name of the file, e.g. "p0101"

algorithm:

    for "CSEE*" in "maktaba.tetea.org/exam-results/
        make new CSV file
        for "[p|s]*" in "CSEE*"
            find "<table>"
            append contents to CSV file
